# Teensy4.0-Test
A noodling around repository for the Teensy 4.0
## Introduction
I have been doing a lot of programming over the past 5 years in the Cypress Semiconductor/Infineon Technology PSoC realm specifically the 5LP. While I really enjoy designing with their PSoCs there are concerns with the Infineon acquision of Cypress as product development seems to have slowed. There have been no new updates to PSoC Creator in a while, and even their last news blog post is coming up on a year old. I would not say it is completely silent, but in my perspective it has slowed.

With that in mind I decided to spread out a bit more exploring other microcontrollers and PSoC devices. The Teensy 4.0 is my first such device. Personally I have in the past steered clear of anything embracing the Arduino framework as I found it too limiting in the development sense. The lack of JTAG/SWD/etc. support is a frustration point for me to the level that I don't think I want to really develop anything serious with the Teensy, but there is an entertainment value exploring what is there (plus the price is right.) 

These projects are part of the Teensy 4.0 exploration. There are no goals in mind other than to code up accessing different peripherals (Serial/SPI/I2C/I2S/etc) and components of the NXP IMXRT1060. Just getting a feel for how the PSoC works and how to code for it. I will be using the PlatformIO Visual Studio Code IDE for the development effort.
